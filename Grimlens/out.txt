Oh no, there are gremlins (or perhaps just one nasty gremlin) in my computer, something weird is happening to my vowels! They seem to be rotated through every word, each vowel replaces the one to its left and the first one moves around to the last position. That's a terribly cruel thing to do. 
 I can see what the gremlin's fiendish algorithm could be. The vowels are picked out of the word, the list is rotated one place left, and the vowels are then replaced in the new order. You will notice that the letter Y is assumed to be a vowel in this context, in addition to the conventional "AEIOU". That's true whether it has a vowel-y usage like "flying" or not (like "yacht", why would the gremlin bother messing around with words describing watercraft?). 
 Evidently a word is a contiguous sequence of non-space ASCII characters surrounded by spaces or the beginning and/or end of a line. Every letter retains the case of its original position, so they look like proper English even if it borders on gibberish. 
 Please write a program that can restore my text to its former glory, these dyslexic misspellings are starting to cause me embarrassment among my friends. Ultimately I know I will be using long words again like straightforwardness and telecommunications, or facetious and abstemious, which both have all the non-Y vowels strictly in order. 
 To prove you have recovered my prose, copy the soon-to-be corrected text from the browser to your program, and copy the output of your program to the box on the submission page. It should make perfect sense.
